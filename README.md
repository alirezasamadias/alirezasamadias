# Hi, I'm Alireza! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
Hello, I am Alireza, and it has been more than a year since I got to know the world of programming.

Web Developer with a strong focus on responsive design and usability as well as creating and optimizing web applications to enhance user experience and performance.

Excellent problem-solving ability and keen eye for detail. Interested in staying up to date with the latest web technologies and innovation and efficiency. Looking to contribute my technical and creative skills to a dynamic team.

I am well versed in Html5 and Css3 and I also know JavaScript at an intermediate level. I am familiar with Sass, Bootstrap and jQuery. I worked with Git and GitHub and the portfolio is fully responsive. There is also a project related to Rest API inside the samples.

Recently I also learned React.js and Vue.js and put some work samples in my resume.
